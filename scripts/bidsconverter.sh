# @title: BIDS Conversion

# This is an automated script for running a BIDS conversion on raw fMRI data (dicom, IMA, (etc?))
# There are a few assumptions made in the script:
# -- The subjects have been renamed to the 'sub*' format, *see 'rename_subjects.sh',
# -- that you are running the script within the Heudiconv singularity shell,
# -- and that you have an available heurisitic file for your data, see 'heuristic_file.py'

# Get start variables:
#_____________________

# main directory path is the 'head' directory, this must contain deeper paths to the input data, output
# folder, and the heuristic file.

# dicom path
